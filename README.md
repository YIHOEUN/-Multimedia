<h3>Requirements</h3>
<a>
1. Create a tool with graphical user interface (GUI) running on desktop or web environment.<br>
2. Create a report summarizing functions in the tool and how did you create thems (at least 5 pages in length). In the report, the roles of each member in team must be mentioned.<br>
3. Present the results and demonstrations <br>
4. Create an image processing tool which has these functions:<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp＊Showing the histogram of an image, convert to grayscale<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp＊Enhance image quality using: histogram equalization, Gramma correction.Filter the image with blurring, smoothing, sharpening.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp＊Saving an image to another formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP)<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp＊Rotate, scaling, flip, warp, crop an image<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp＊Convert video, webcam to grayscale, flip the video/webcam (90, 180, 270 degrees).<br>
5. Using YOLO/SSD/Faster-RCNN/… to: Counting cat in a video
